# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description

Employee Payroll tracker application is built to track employee annual salaries and enables employer to budget the funds for employees accordingly.
The application takes employee information including salary and dynamically generates the table to display employee information. Console logs the average salary of
employees and radomly chosen employee as a winner.

The motivation behind this project is to add user interaction with the application using Javascript. Objects, Arrays and Primitives were used to capture employee information
and perform calculations for average salary. DOM manipulation was used to generate dynamic table to present employee information.
